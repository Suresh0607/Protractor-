Import all selenium jars into your project so that code compiles

POM>.xml - project dependencies

package.json
- all the dependencies

npm install
=========================
Steps:
1. Create a folder and open it in VSNode
2. Run command 'npm init' to create default package.json
3. Answer all the questions asked on command prompt and the default package.json is created
4. now download and install all dependencies (go to https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/5.4.1/exampleTypescript)
- jasmine
- protractor
- typescript
- @types/jasmine (jasmine cant understand typescript and same with node, this is why we need this dependency. Intruducing typescript flavor in JS Jsmine)
- @types/jasminewd2
- ts-node (why? this is not converted into @types)
- @types/node
5) Install protractor using command 'npm install protractor'
6) For all other dependencies, either run the command for each of them selarately or add them within 'package.json' and then install using 'npm install'

NEXT - working with the project
================================
1. You need a spec file with define and it blocks. So create one spec file with .ts extension
2. Add 'import {browser, element, by} from "protractor" statement at the top to change the JS to TS. It then understands browser, element and by keywords
3. Then create the configuration.ts file to add the configurations to run the tests (same as JS project)
4. Change to exports.config to 'export let config: Config=' and again import protractor statement at the top
5. Now as protractor can not understand typescript, it needs to be compiled back to javascript to run it. So now we need a compiler to do this job. For this we need tsconfig.json file that will make the configurations for the same purpose.
6. Run command "tsc --init" to create tsconfig.ts file (but make sure typescript is installed globally using "npm install -g typescript")
7. Then convert all typescript files into JS using command 'tsc' (but make sure you have 'npm install -g typescript' run)
8. Then run the test using command "protractor filename_configuration" where .js file has to be used. But before running this, make sure you are in that folder where this file is present
(protractor JSFiles/configuration.js)
9. The above command may fail with "No specs found" because your specns might be defined in .ts. So change the name of spec from .ts to .Js

==========================

Webdriver might depricate control flow soon so then we would either need to handle the promises on our own for every step. That is very cumbersome.
OR
handle it using async/await concept.

1. Every step u write, make sure u put await keyword. Initially it will give error, so that function name is async.

============================

Importance of 'Scripts' in package.json. It allows you to write all things defined and with one command run the test.

"scripts": {
    "test":"protractor JSFiles/configuration.js",
    "protractor":"./node_modules/protractor/built/cli.js",
    "webdriver-update":"./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update",
    "pretest": "tsc",
    "testerror": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
